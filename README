OpenTox Features
=================

* An OpenTox REST Webservice

* Provides canonical URIs for features in the form /feature_name/feature_value

* Does not store them permanently in a database

* Implements a subset of the OpenTox feature API (http://opentox.org/wiki/opentox/Feature).

* Runs at http://webservices.in-silico.ch/features

* No documentation yet, have a look at features.rb - it should be self-explanatory.

* Requirements:

	- Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/),
	- sinatra-url-for (http://github.com/emk/sinatra-url-for/)
	- Rack::Test (http://github.com/brynary/rack-test/) for the tests
